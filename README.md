# Buttery Taskbar
Save space on your screen by *permanently* hiding the taskbar when it's not needed. This is **a much-needed fix for Windows' default taskbar auto-hide.**

Essentially, we're combining the taskbar with the Start Menu.

## The Purpose of a Buttery Taskbar
The taskbar in Windows can be rather annoying—especially if you want to maximise your screen's real estate. So, I developed Buttery Taskbar.

In addition to making your Windows desktop feel **cleaner and less cluttered,** the underlying goal of this simple application is to **increase your productivity.**

- **Buttery Taskbar has only one purpose: to keep the taskbar hidden when the Start Menu is closed,** and vice versa.
- It is beautifully simple and lightweight.
- Placing the mouse cursor on the edge of the screen will not show the taskbar.

### What's Wrong With the Regular Taskbar Auto-Hide?
While you can achieve this with the built-in auto-hide feature, it isn't without its problems. As I have alluded to earlier, the taskbar can be *annoying*.

For example, I've found it immensely irritating when accidentally moving the cursor to the edge of the screen on which the taskbar is situated. The consequence? That intrusive taskbar glides onto the screen, *shamelessly,* hence **denying me access to the controls I desire.** Subsequently, I would have to withdraw my cursor and attempt the manoeuvre once more.

Also, even if I don't run into the taskbar, extra effort is necessary to avoid it.

Regardless of what side of the screen the taskbar is on, **auto-hide *will* get in your way.**

Moreover, the taskbar can occasionally get your face when you least expect it; applications that want your attention, for example, **will stop at nothing to keep that taskbar *open*.** It must know that you would rather stare at a flashing orange icon rather than continue your highly-focused work in Microsoft Word!

## Installation and Usage
**Download the [latest release](https://github.com/CrypticButter/ButteryTaskbar/releases) of Buttery Taskbar.**

**Make sure to set your taskbar to auto-hide.** Although we won't be using the taskbar-appears-on-cursor-hover element of this feature, it is essential for a happy, positive experience. If you don't do this, you'll end up with a huge, unusable gap where the taskbar would be. Auto-hide makes this gap tiny.

You will need to use the Windows key to view the taskbar.

## Tips for Making the Most of Your Buttery Taskbar
You may be asking, 
*"But wait! Doesn't this application bring more inconvenience than it does good?"*
**No.**

If you're used to using the mouse a lot, it may take some time to get used to your new Buttery Taskbar. However, once you do, the benefits will be worth it.

### Leveraging Keyboard Shortcuts
There are other ways to navigate the Windows desktop—without the need of the taskbar, of course. These include shortcuts such as:
- `Windows key` + `Tab` *(Task View)*
- (`Ctrl` +) `Alt` + `Tab` *(switch between windows)*
- `Alt` + `Escape` (cycle through windows in the order in which they were last used)
These shortcuts enhance productivity by themselves, even without a Buttery Taskbar!

### Get Yourself Some Macro Keys—on Your Mouse
Additionally, you can do what I love very much: **using a multitude of macro keys on a mouse.**

My top recommendation is the Logitech G502, which is brilliant for productivity at a great price. For more details, you can see [my epic review](https://crypticbutter.com/best-mouse-for-programming-g502/).

With this mouse, you can bind various shortcuts to the programmable buttons (like the Windows key) for efficient navigation of the Windows desktop. This will give you the best experience using Buttery Taskbar.

### Embrace the *Superior* Taskbar!
![Use a vertical taskbar for maximum productivity](https://i.imgur.com/4GcKLupl.png)

Another way to make your taskbar better is to **use a vertical, wide taskbar.** Because you only see it when the Start Menu is open, the taskbar width doesn't matter.
